Time Series Textbooks (All Online, Free via Cornell Library):
* [Shumway and Stoffer (2006)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007\%2F0-387-36276-2) is our main reference. Based on my research, it's the best regarded textbook for a course of this type. That said, there are some parts where notation gets quite confusing and we'll stray from it a bit.
* [Chan (2010)](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781118032466) is a really lovely book that has very clear explanations, but sometimes goes a bit above and beyond the technical level we want for this class.
* [Cowpertwait and Metcalfe (2009)](https://link-springer-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/book/10.1007\%2F978-0-387-88698-5) is a simpler book that focuses more on `R`. It's not quite technical enough to be a primary reference for this course, but it is a very nice place to learn various concepts, e.g. how to simulate from different time series models.
* [Tsay (2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470644560) is a on a similar but slightly more advanced level than our course, but it contains less `R` code and is more financially oriented.
* [Brockwell and Davis (1991)](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387974293) is too technical for our purposes and doesn't have much in the way of `R` examples. But, it is very detailed and comprehensive. When I want to make sure I understand how something I'll be teaching can be proven, I look here.
* [Homes, Scheuerell, and Ward (2018)](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa-labs/) is a very practically oriented online textbook motivated by time series problems in Fisheries and the Environmental Sciences.

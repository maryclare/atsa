  Project
-------


Summary of Tasks:
  
- Submit a data set;
- Choose a data set from the approved datasets;
- Submit first analysis;
- Submit second analysis;
- Submit final paper.

  
  Before spring break, I will collect potential datasets. Over spring break, I will explore the submitted data and decide which ones seem well suited for the project. Three of the data sets that I deem well suited for the project will beselected from the rest according to the results of an in class survey. You may choose from these three for your final project.
  
  
  
## Submitting a Potential Dataset

Submissions submitted by 12:00pm noon on Sunday, March 31 will be considered. It is ok (and encouraged) to submit as a group! For full consideration, the submission should be at most one page and should include:

- One to five sentences describing the data, specifically:
    - The names of the students in the group;
    - How the data was obtained;
    - What the data are measuring;
    - The number of observations (if the data you're interested in contains multiple time series, just describe the number of observations for a single one)
    - The amount of time between each observed value.
    
- A single time series plot (if the data you're interested in contains multiple time series, just pick one);
- A sample autocorrelation plot;
- A sample partial autocorrelation plot.

All students who submit at least one potential dataset will have a single bonus point added to their final project grade.

Here are some links to some places to look for data, which range from data repositories that contain cleaned datasets that are often used to demonstrate various concepts to places where raw (uncleaned) time series data is available for download:

## Rubric for Final Paper
  
The final project will be:
- 5 pages long including figures and tables, excluding `R` code and references;
- Double spaced, with font size 12 and 1 inch margins;
- Written using `R` Markdown;
- Be accompanied by `R` code that reproduces all results.
  
A template will be provided.
  
It will be graded out of 25 points as follows:
- (5 points) Accurate description of changes made according to instructor and teaching assistant feedback on previous versions;
- (4 points) Introduction and exploratory analyses;
- (6 points) First analysis;
- (6 points) Second analysis;
- (4 points) Conclusions.

One bonus point will be added if the student submitted a suggested dataset by 12:00pm noon on Sunday, March 31.

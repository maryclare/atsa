## General Guidelines
* Always due by 12:00pm (noon) on Thursdays, submitted online via Blackboard as a `.pdf`.
* Problems that require use of `R` must be written up using `R` Markdown. 
    - You can find some example `R` Markdown syntax in the `.md` files for the slides I show in class in [my GitHub repository for the slides](https://github.com/maryclare/atsa/tree/master/content/slides). Although these are slides, the main points regarding formatting and use of `R` chunks are the same for all `R` Markdown generated documents.
    - You can make a `.pdf` file by either compiling an `.Rmd` file directly to `.pdf` (this may require that you have additional software installed on your computer) or by compiling an `.Rmd` file to `.html`, opening it in your browser, and then saving it as a `.pdf`.
* Raw `R` output alone will not be accepted as a solution.
* Figures and tables must be clearly and fully annotated.

## Resources for `R`
* We will use `R` extensively. Here are some recommended resources if are either entirely or somewhat new to to `R`:
    - [`swirl`](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) is a very unique resource that teaches you how to use `R` from within `R`. I recommend the ``R Programming'' course, it's surprisingly fun even if you know most or all of the concepts already!
    - The folks at RStudio have made a nice [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf) that summarizes various essential features of `R`.
    - `CRAN` has a very comprehensive [reference card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf).
    - The course page for [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://rebeccaferrell.github.io/CSSS508/), a course on `R` taught at the University of Washington a few years ago.
    - The book [Advanced `R`](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham gives a very detailed look at `R`'s data structures, e.g. matrices, arrays, and data frames.
    - DataCamp has a popular and free [Introduction to `R`](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course that is popular.
* You will also learn a lot by comparing your homework solutions to the ones I provide, although keep in mind that the way I code up solutions to the homework problems is rarely the only way someone could code them up!

## General Guidelines
* Always due by 12:00pm on Thursdays, submitted online via Blackboard.
* Problems that require use of `R` must be written up using `R` Markdown.
    - You can find some example `R` Markdown syntax in the `.md` files for the slides I show in class in [my GitHub repository for the slides](https://github.com/maryclare/atsa/tree/master/content/slides). Although these are slides, the main points regarding formatting and use of `R` chunks are the same for all `R` Markdown generated documents.
* Raw `R` output alone will not be accepted as a solution.
* Figures and tables must be clearly and fully annotated.
